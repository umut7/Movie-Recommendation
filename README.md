# Movie Recommendation System

This project implements a movie recommendation system using collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques. It utilizes a dataset of movies and user ratings to recommend similar movies based on user preferences.

The project includes:
- Movie search functionality.
- Real-time recommendation generation based on user input.
- Cosine similarity for content-based recommendations.
- Collaborative filtering using user ratings to recommend movies that similar users liked.

## Features

- **Movie Search**: Users can search for movies by typing a title, and the system will return the most relevant matches.
- **Collaborative Filtering**: The system uses user ratings to find similar users and recommend movies they rated highly.
- **Content-Based Filtering**: It also uses cosine similarity based on movie titles to recommend similar movies.


## Technologies

### Example

When you type in a movie title, the system will provide similar movie recommendations. For example, if you search for "Toy Story," it will display a list of similar movies based on both user preferences and content similarity.
